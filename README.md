# dtn7-rs
Rust implementation of DTN7 Bundle Protocol draft https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dtn-bpbis-12

This is more or less a port of the dtn7 golang implementation: https://github.com/geistesk/dtn7


Currently lacking any functionality except for (de)serializing of bundles, no convergence layers implemented. 
Also the API is not very idiomatic rust and lacks documentation and tests. 
Since I consider this code to be very unpolished and far from finished it is also not published on crates.io yet.
